BABA,185.13,BUY,"On the heels of public disclosures that the stock is being accumulated by large stock market players, BABA again reported strong YOY financials bolstering a technically strong chart.",13000000,17800000,0.7,56,179,141.9,210,1 month,179,6:25,"Alibaba's earnings report came in above expectations, showing YOY growth of 40%. 'Single's Day' sales exceeded last year's figures by 30%, while outlooks and earnings forecasts continue to be upbeat for the name. From a technical standpoint, the stock has been extremely strong, having more than doubled so far in 2017. Considering the trend, and current fundamentals, the stock is rated at a strong buy going forward with a price target of $210, which implies a favorable risk-to-reward trade with a stop-loss at $179."
JD,40.25,HOLD,"Despite a weak earnings report recently, this name has been holding its own, in part due to the strength in the space. As a direct competitor to Alibaba, this name is rated a HOLD due to relative weakness within a strong industry.",16600000,14650000,1.1,52.66,36.05,N/A,40,3 months,N/A,N/A,"Coverage on this stock is rated at a HOLD, which implies a no-trade. Due to the relative weakness in this symbol versus its competitors in the space (namely, BABA) we do not believe there is a favorable setup to place a trade. After reporting weaker than expected earnings, coupled with strong results from Alibaba (its direct competitor), we expect sideways to negative price action. Technically, this symbol is above its 50 day moving average, implying bullish activity, with greater relative volume. However, because of the competitive headwinds, this is a symbol to avoid in the next 3 months until a positive or negative cataylst would warrant a favorable setup."
TSLA,315.05,SELL,"Overwhelming operating expenses are proving to be too much of a headwind for this symbol to overcome, despite a successfull rollout of its new semi line of trucks. Investors should take caution with this name.",13700000,6100000,2.2,46.16,304.62,242.74,215,4 months,340,25:100,"TSLA's cash burn is ever-increasing despite heightened sales figures for its full lineup. In addition, production concerns and inefficiencies have led investors to be concerned about its ability to meet demand. Its recent launch of its new semi line of trucks came with notable headlines including WalMart signing up. However, the operating margins are weighing down the name and the stock is suffering. Technically speaking, the symbol is consolidating at the 50 day moving average. We believe the fundamental outlook will pull this name down, with a price target of $215, which would take it about 10% below its 200 day moving average."
